# Music Streaming Web Application

## Introduction

Rewriting the capstone project I worked on from scratch in an effort to learn and expand upon the technologies used in the original project.

Eventually I would like to utilize Google or Amazon's cloud services to store and stream audio files, but for now I will continue to store the files locally in the API's file system.

## What's next ?

- [ ] Connect docker containers
- [ ] Explore chunk sizes for streaming
